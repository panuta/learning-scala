# Function vs. Method

**Method** is a function inside a class. It cannot be passed as variable.

**Function** is a value, we can pass around and manipulate

> A Scala method is a part of a class which has a name, a signature, optionally some annotations, and some bytecode where as a function in Scala is a complete object which can be assigned to a variable. In other words, a function, which is defined as a member of some object, is called a method.
